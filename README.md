# System Design Food Application

A comprehensive system design project demonstrating the architecture and implementation of a scalable food delivery application. This repository contains domain models, business logic, and extensive documentation covering various system design concepts.

## 📋 Overview

This project showcases a phased approach to building a food delivery platform, with emphasis on system design principles, scalability, and best practices. It includes domain models for core entities like Food, Restaurant, User, and Order, along with detailed implementation phases.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

### Core Implementation Files
- **phase1.py** - Domain models (Food, Restaurant, User, Order)
- **phase2.py** - Additional business logic and services
- **phase3.py** - Extended functionality
- **phase4.py** - Advanced features
- **phase5.py** - Integration components
- **phase6.py** - Supporting modules
- **phase7.py** - Final implementation phase

### Documentation
- **documentation.docx** - Project documentation
- **internalfunction/** - Comprehensive system design resources
  - `SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW ANSWER.ipynb` - System design interview preparation
  - `failurehandiling.ipynb` - Failure handling strategies
  - `howtoscale1millionusers.ipynb` - Scaling strategies for high traffic
  - `indexes & database performance.ipynb` - Database optimization techniques
  - `real database schema.ipynb` - Production database schema design
  - `study.ipynb`, `study2.ipynb`, `study3.ipynb` - Additional study materials

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Models**: Core entities representing the business domain
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and operations
- **Data Layer**: Database schemas and optimizations
- **Scalability**: Design patterns for handling millions of users

## 🚀 Key Features

- Object-oriented domain modeling
- Order management system
- Restaurant and menu management
- User management
- Comprehensive system design documentation
- Scalability patterns and best practices
- Database performance optimization
- Failure handling mechanisms

## 📚 Learning Resources

The `internalfunction/` directory contains valuable Jupyter notebooks covering:

- System design interview preparation
- Scaling applications to handle 1M+ users
- Database indexing and performance tuning
- Failure handling and resilience patterns
- Real-world database schema design

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Documentation Format**: Jupyter Notebook, DOCX
- **Focus Areas**: System Design, Architecture, Scalability
