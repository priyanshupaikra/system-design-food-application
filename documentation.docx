think of layers:
user -> API layer -> services -> cache/Queue -> database

PHASE 0 — Core Problem Understanding (ZERO LEVEL)
What does a food delivery app actually do?

1. User browses restaurants
2. User places an order
3. Order is processed
4. Delivery partner is assigned
5. Order status updates
6. Notifications sent

PHASE 1 — Core Data Models (Very Basic Python)
Step 1: Entities (Food, Restaurant, User, Order)

PHASE 2 — Simple Order Placement Service

PHASE 3 — CACHE (Like Redis) Using Python Dict
Why Cache?
Fetching restaurant/menu repeatedly is expensive

PHASE 4 — RATE LIMITING (CRITICAL INTERVIEW TOPIC)
Problem:
Prevent user from spamming order API.

PHASE 5 — MESSAGE QUEUE (ORDER PROCESSING)
Why Queue?
Order processing is slow
Don’t block user

PHASE 6 — LOAD BALANCING (LOGIC LEVEL)

PHASE 7 — DELIVERY PARTNER ASSIGNMENT (ADVANCED)

Learnings:
Cache
Rate limiting
Message queues
Load balancing
Async processing
State transitions
